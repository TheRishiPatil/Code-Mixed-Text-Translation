# Code-Mixed-Text-Translation

In this project, we developed a translation system designed to handle code-mixed text, with a focus on translating Indic languages, particularly Marathi, into English. Code-mixed text, which is a blend of words and phrases from different languages, presents unique challenges for traditional translation models due to its hybrid nature.Our system leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accurately detect and translate codemixed text. By focusing on Marathi, a widely spoken language in India, our project addresses the increasing need for effective translation tools in multilingual contexts. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a robust and efficient translation system that can be extended to other Indic languages, helping to bridge language barriers and facilitate communication in diverse linguistic settings.
